The name's Can Çelenay. Turkish. Godot and Rust enjoyer, and the man who is gonna fill this blog with total peak.

Now, with the obligatory TF2 reference out of the way...

## Seriously, who the hell am I?

I am Can Çelenay, also known as Brogolem35. The sole owner of this blog.

I am an aspiring game developer who enjoys developing stuff using Rust, Godot, or both at the same time.

I love low-level development. I love C. I love Rust. I hate (but tolerate) C++.

## Skills and Projects

### Godot:

Been using Godot for 2 years, around the time Unity did the runtime fee thingy.

I mostly developed 2D pixel-art games. [godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext), my beloved.

Games I worked on:
- [Chunk And Hunger](https://brogolem35.itch.io/chunk-and-hunger): 2D puzzle survival game made for the Ludum Dare 54.
- [P.H.A.N.T.O.M.](https://brogolem35.itch.io/phantom): Top-down puzzle game made for the Mağara Jam 2023.
- [Stealth Strike](https://brogolem35.itch.io/stealth-strike): Stealth puzzle game made for the Jamination 7 game jam.
- [AlonzoTech](https://sourlemon4.itch.io/alonzotech): Roguelike factory/deck builder made for the EGGJAM.
- [Botsies](https://github.com/Brogolem35/botsies): Reimplementation of [Footsies](https://github.com/hifight/Footsies), made for reinforcement learning training.

### Rust:

Also been using Rust for 2 years. Because my mother tongue was C, Rust did not feel foreign at all.

I have published 2 crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/):
- [markov_str](https://github.com/Brogolem35/markov_str): Markov Chain text generator. Can be serialized and deserialized through [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).
- [wcount](https://github.com/Brogolem35/wcount): CLI word counting tool.

Like I mentioned in the [Godot section](#godot), I also use Rust to code GdExtensions:
- [Botsies](https://github.com/Brogolem35/botsies)

I have some experience programming backend servers with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum). Mostly for my university projects.
- [markov-chain-backend](https://github.com/Brogolem35/markov-chain-backend): Based on a very old version of the `markov_str`.

### Node.js

I have experience developing Discord bots:
- [kawga-bot](https://github.com/Brogolem35/kawga-bot): Discord bot to organize fighting game hosting. It is currently used in [Turkish Meltycord](https://discord.com/invite/vj62m6PMbh).

I made backends for hobby and university projects with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). 

### C and C++

Casual C enjoyer.

Have decent experience with Arduino and ESP32.

### Unity

My first game engine. I have some not-so-fond memories with it.

Games I worked on:
- [Attack on Turtle](https://abuzitin2000.itch.io/attack-on-turtle): A 2D puzzle platformer made for the Jamination 6 game jam within 48 hours.
- [Valley of the Horse](https://brogolem35.itch.io/valleyofthehorse): A top-down puzzle action game made for the GMTK Game Jam within 48 hours.

I also worked on a game that was used to showcase our DEU POG student club.

### C#

Programmed backend servers on my internship using ASP.NET.

Like mentioned before, I have experience with Unity.

## How did I, a frontend buffoon, make this site?

[Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). It even has support for [RSS](/index.xml), which was a big deal for me.

The theme was made by me, with some components I gathered around. The site source can be found [here]().

The site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages.
